# Implementation-and-Performance-analysis-of-MIMO-and-MIMO-OFDM
 Simulated and analysed the performance of ZF and LMMSE equalizing techniques in MIMO Rx.
 ◦ Plotted MIMO capacity for equal vs. optimal power allocation found by using water filling algorithm.
 ◦ Performed simulation for MIMO-OFDM system and analysed the BER performance for varying SNR..
