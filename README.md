# Implementation-and-Performance-analysis-of-MIMO-and-MIMO-OFDM Systems
 1. Simulated and analysed the performance of ZF and LMMSE equalizing techniques in MIMO Rx.
 2. Plotted MIMO capacity for equal vs. optimal power allocation found by using water filling algorithm.
 3. Performed simulation for MIMO-OFDM system and analysed the BER performance for varying SNR..
